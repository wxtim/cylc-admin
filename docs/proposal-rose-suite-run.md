# Proposal - rose suite-run functionality migration to cylc

The work described in this document aims to:
* Unify global and suite configs.
* Change the way hosts for jobs are selected to improve support for clusters.
* Deprecate `rose suite-run` and provide a new cylc command to replace it.

This will complete [cylc-flow #1885](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues/1885).

## Work Plan

1. Combine global and suite configs.
   See [cylc-flow #3420](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues/3420).

2. Implement basic platforms support.
   See [platforms proposal](proposal-platforms.md).

3. Add new platforms features required to support rose suite-run functionality.
   See [platforms proposal](proposal-platforms.md#enhancements-to-support-rose-suite-run-functionality).

4. Define new cylc command to replace rose suite-run (and adapt rose suite-run
   to provide backwards compatibility). See [below](#replacing-rose-suite-run).

The remaining points can happen any time after 2) is complete although note that
3) and 4) are higher priority.

5. Support generation of cylc config reference documentation from the code and
   ensure all settings are documented.
   See [cylc-doc #11](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-doc/issues/11).
   Alternatively, review and update the existing documentation.

6. Implement further enhancements to the platforms support.
   See [platforms proposal](proposal-platforms.md#further-enhancements).
   Note that these are not essential for Cylc 8.0.

7. Review all config settings and make any agreed changes.
   See [cylc-flow #3422](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues/3422).
   Note that these are not essential for Cylc 8.0 although we should try to
   address any non-controversial changes.

   Note: close PR #3348 & issue #3404 and link into #3422?
   Also [cylc-admin #43](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-admin/issues/43)?

## Replacing rose suite-run

### Key Functionality

1. Installation of suites on platforms and support for moving the share, work &
   log directories to different locations. Currently this is done by
   `rose suite-run` but we will include this in the
   [platforms support](proposal-platforms.md#enhancements-to-support-rose-suite-run-functionality).

2. On start up and reload, install the suite from the source location (working
   copy) to the run location (`cylc-run`).
   * Currently this functionality assumes a shared filesystem but we should
     support workflow server hosts with separate filesystems (future
     enhancement?).
   * Needs to create the run time directory structure which has been configured
     for the `localhost` platform.

3. On start up, housekeep / archive logs and other items generated by the suite.

4. On start up and reload, validate suite (using `--strict`).
   * Hopefully this can become a standard part of suite start-up rather than a
     separate step. This was difficult previously because cylc loads the suite
     after it has been detached?

5. Handle `rose-suite.conf` functionality
   * Pull items from other locations / sources on installation (e.g. svn).
   * Configure Jinja2 / EmPy inputs.
   * Set environment variables exported to the suite daemon?
   * Continue to handle `rose-suite.conf` using a plugin preprocessor.
   * Decide which features to support natively in Cylc and how.

6. Utility to remove installed locations (on all platforms) on demand
   (equivalent to `rose suite-clean`).

7. On starting up a new run of the suite assign a new run name:
   ```
   mi-aa001/
     run1
     run2
   ```
   * This is new functionality but Cylc 8 is a good time to introduce it.
   * Use a symbolic link to identify the latest run which is the default name
     when performing operations on a suite?

8. Consider the behaviour created by the `CYLC_VERSION` and `ROSE_VERSION`
   variables in `rose-suite.conf`. These allow rose suite-run to:
   * Change the version of Cylc and check the version of Rose used to run the
     suite.
   * Prevent suites accidentally upgrading or downgrading versions on restart.

9. Consider `rose prune` functionality.
   * Need to make sure it will continue to work correctly.
   * Need Cylc equivalent but this should be done as part of
     [cylc-flow #1159](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues/1159).

### CLI

We need a new Cylc command to replace `rose suite-run`.
See [cylc-flow #1030](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues/1030)
* Rationalise the run/restart/reload CLI/API?
* Existing cylc commands: `cylc run`, `cylc restart`, cylc `reload`.
* Existing rose commands: `rose suite-run`, `rose suite-restart`.
* Other related rose commands: `rose suite-shutdown`, `rose stem`.
* Need to decide which commands to support for backwards compatibility?
  Which commands can we just remove?
